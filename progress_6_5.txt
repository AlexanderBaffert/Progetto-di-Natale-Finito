You find another path and you cross it
...
You find a door and you open it
...
You are in a room that seems normal
...
In the center of the room there is a table with a skull-shaped cup on it
...
You start to go near it and you touch the cup
...
The cup start to shake and a black fog start to appear near the cup
...
You get blinded for some seconds and you realized that you got teleported
...
You are in a area all black and you dont see nothing
...
You see a silhouette in the dark
...
